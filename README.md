StarCat Optoisolator Shield
===========================

This is an opto-isolated digital input/output shield for the Arduino Due.

It's good for synchronizing digital equipment (push-buttons, etc.) with an Arduino Due
system - useful when sensitive ADC measurements are being taken. Meant for use 
with the [HackEEG](https://github.com/adamfeuer/hackeeg-shield) 24-bit EEG ADC board.

Features
========

* 4 opto-isolated inputs
* 2 opo-isolated outputs
* Screw terminals for connecting external inputs and outputs
* Uses Vishay [ILD213T](http://www.vishay.com/docs/83647/ild205t.pdf) optoisolator IC
