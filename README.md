StarCat Optoisolator Shield
===========================

This is an opto-isolated digital input/output shield for the Arduino Due.

It's good for low-noise synchronization of digital equipment (push-buttons, etc.) with 
an Arduino Due system. The optical isolation enables the connection of otherwise-noisy
external circuits or equipment, preventing ground or power supply noise from affecting 
sensitive ADC measurements. 

Meant for use with the [HackEEG](https://github.com/adamfeuer/hackeeg-shield) 24-bit EEG 
ADC board.

Features
========

* 4 opto-isolated inputs
* 2 opo-isolated outputs
* Screw terminals for connecting external inputs and outputs
* Uses Vishay [ILD213T](http://www.vishay.com/docs/83647/ild205t.pdf) optoisolator IC
